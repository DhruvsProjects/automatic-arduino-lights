# automatic-arduino-lights
A basic arduino project to understand the working of a photoresistor and if-else statements

Components needed:
1) A microcontroller (An Arduino UNO R3 was used in this project)
2) Jumper wires
3) Resistor(Resistance depending on the sensitvity of lights based on your application)
4) Photoresistor
5) Breadboard
