# automatic-arduino-lights
A basic arduino project to create an automatic lighting system while understanding the working of a photoresistor.

Components needed:
1) A microcontroller (An Arduino UNO R3 was used in this project)
2) Jumper wires
3) Resistor(Resistance depending on the sensitvity of lights based on your application)
4) Photoresistor
5) Breadboard
We will be using the built in LED of the arduino (which is assigned to pin 13 for most boards) as using an LED close to the photoresistor will cause interference
